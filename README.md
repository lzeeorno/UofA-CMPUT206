Understanding of Digital Image Processing is important to further your journey into various CS sub-disciplines, such as computational photography, image editing, 3D model building and manipulation, computer graphics and animation, computer vision and image recognition, and robot navigation to name a few. This course is an introduction to basic digital image processing theory and simple algorithms and tools. We will be using Scikit-image with a Python interface for the practical / lab. We will also use Google colaboratory for all labs and assignments. It will cover a Digital Multimedia Theme at the University of Alberta.
